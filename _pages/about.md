I am Mauricio Cruz-Loya, a PhD candidate in Biomathematics at the [Department of Computational Medicine](https://compmed.ucla.edu/), UCLA. I work at the [Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences](https://qcb.ucla.edu/) under the supervision of [Van Savage](https://vsavage.faculty.biomath.ucla.edu/). My work focuses on the combined effect of antibiotics and other stressors, such as temperature, in the growth of bacteria.

(Under construction, more to come...)
