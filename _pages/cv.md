* Summer 2019
 * Mentored 2 undergraduate students as part of the Bruins in Genomics program. I designed and supervised their project, which involved using network approaches to study allosterism in human liver pyruvate kinase.

I conceived of the research project, helped her design the experiments and make a poster at the end of the summer rotation.
