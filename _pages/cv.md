Mentoring
======
* Summer 2019
    * Mentored 2 undergraduate students as part of the Bruins in Genomics program. I designed and supervised their project, which involved using network approaches to study allosterism in human liver pyruvate kinase.
    * Co-mentored a Sally Casanova undergraduate scholar. Her project involved measuring the temperature response of bacterial growth under different concentrations of antibiotics. I conceived of the research project, helped her design the experiments and make a poster at the end of the summer rotation.
